# Bioinformatics-Pipeline-Simulator


# Bioinformatics Pipeline Simulator

Simulate a bioinformatics analysis pipeline (e.g., RNA-seq).
Features: Users can select different analysis steps (trimming, alignment, differential expression) and visualize the results at each stage.


## Installation



Install Streamlit and any necessary libraries:



```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
    
## Basic File Structure  

  1-app.py: Main application file. 
  
  2-requirements.txt: List of dependencies.
## Features Overview

## Pipeline Steps

## Trimming: 
Simulate the trimming of low-quality bases from raw reads.

## Alignment: 
Align trimmed reads to a reference genome.

## Differential Expression: 
Analyze gene expression data to identify differentially expressed genes.

## Visualization
Display graphs and metrics after each step (e.g., quality scores, alignment metrics, DE results).

## User Input
Allow users to upload sample data (e.g., FASTQ files) and select analysis options.
## Additional Features to Implement

## Detailed Visualizations:

Add more plots, such as boxplots for expression data or quality scores before and after each step.

## Download Results:

Provide options for users to download the analysis results as CSV or other formats.

## Pipeline Customization:

Allow users to customize parameters for each analysis step (e.g., alignment parameters, DE thresholds).

## Help Section:

Include a section explaining each step of the pipeline and its significance.

## Persistent Storage:

Implement options to save session data, so users can revisit their analyses.
## Deployment 

To deploy your app, consider using Streamlit Sharing or platforms like Heroku or AWS.
